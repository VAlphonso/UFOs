# UFOs
## Overview of Project
In this project, I created a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. I created five filter boxes to filter various aspects of the data using certain criteria and returned the requested table. I then placed the table into an HTML file and used GitHub to host the webpage. 

The data pertains to documented accounts of people witnessing UFO sights. This webpage allows users to gain an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by city, state, country, and shape of sighting. The idea is to let the user filter through all the facts and come up with there own understandings and realizations if life really exists on other worlds and if they are visiting us today.  

## Results
The filter boxes are easy to use and simple to understand. Here is a screenshot of the filter boxes:

The user will simply fill in the corresponding box to which they will be exploring further data. They will use the example provided to understand the formatting inside the filter boxes. Once the perameter is filled-in, the user will simply press Enter on their keyboard and the results will be displayed. The following example is a user inputing the state filter box to search for all sightings in Wisconsin.

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that it is static. So, as new data comes in, it can not be displayed or used automatically. 
One additional recommendation for further development is to allow users to input their own experiences and save them. 
A second recommendation is to show graphs (perhaps a pie graph) of the percentage of the different types of shapes that were documented.
